# Smart Contract Delivery — One-Pager

## Problem
- Teams need reproducible, verifiable Web3 deliverables (tests/CI/evidence)
- Onchain demo & verification are often missing in MVPs

## Solution
- Launchkit: ERC20 factory, taxed token, fee router, vesting, CI, evidence packs
- Proven integration on Sepolia with verifiable links

## Evidence
- Day5–Day9 packs: tests, gas, Etherscan links, Slither reports

## Process
1) Kickoff & scope confirmation (1h)
2) Dev & tests (daily progress)
3) Onchain verify (if included)
4) Handover & doc

## Timeline & Pricing
- CI in 48h; ERC20 + features in 3–5 days; vesting + UI in 5–7 days
- Fixed price per offer
