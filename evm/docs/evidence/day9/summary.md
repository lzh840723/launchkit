# Day9 â€” Slither Report Summary (Revised)

## Target
- Contracts: FeeRouter, TaxedERC20, TokenFactory, VestingVault
- Tool: Slither (solc 0.8.24)

## Results
- **High: 0**
- **Medium: 0**
- Low: a few (time progression/timestamp dependency, informational hints); no security impact
- Notes: VestingVault adopts ReentrancyGuard + CEI; TaxedERC20/Router integration tests have passed.

## Files
- Before (JSON): `slither-before.json`
- Before (MD): `slither-before.md`
- After (JSON): `slither-after.json`
- After (MD): `slither-after.md`
- Diff: `slither-diff.md`
- After (full with logs): see `evm/reports/slither-after-full.md` (contains stdout + stderr)

## Additional Notes
- Timestamp-related Low items are inherent to the business logic (linear vesting progresses over time) and acceptable.
- Optimization hints (e.g., marking certain values `immutable`) are performance/code-smell suggestions and are deferred to a later PR.
