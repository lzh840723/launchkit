# Day 2 Deliverable (No FeeRouter Variant)

> Mainline: `TokenFactory (Ownable)` + `TaxedERC20 (taxBps + taxCollector)`
> Toolchain: Solidity `0.8.24`, EVM `paris`, Foundry/Forge

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Done Today

* [x] Scaffolding cleanup: removed `Counter.*`
* [x] Tests:

  * `test/TaxedERC20.t.sol`: tax deduction, whitelist no-tax, pause protection, `transferFrom`, tax destination
  * `test/Factory.t.sol`: owner-only creation, 100% initial supply to owner
* [x] Reports: `reports/gas-day2.txt`, `reports/coverage-day2.txt`, `reports/slither-day2.txt`
* [x] Deployment script stub: `script/DeployFactory.s.sol`
* [x] This document

## üß™ Test Results (All Green)

* Suites: 2; Tests: 7; **Passed: 7 / 7**; Failed: 0; Skipped: 0

Key verifications:

* **3% tax**: `10 ‚Üí 9.7 / 0.3` (receiver / fee collector)
* **Whitelist no-tax**: transfers exempt after owner whitelists address
* **Pause guard**: `transfer` reverts after `pause()`
* **Factory access**: only owner can `createToken`
* **Initial supply**: 100% minted to token owner (the `owner()` passed to constructor)

Command (saved to `reports/gas-day2.txt`):

```bash
forge test --gas-report -vv | tee reports/gas-day2.txt
```

## üîé Slither Static Analysis

Command (saved to `reports/slither-day2.txt`):

```bash
slither . --config-file slither.config.json | tee reports/slither-day2.txt
```

Result: **0 High / 0 Medium**. There are **2 informational** findings:

* `TaxedERC20` missing zero-address checks for:

  * constructor param `taxCollector_`
  * `setTax(uint16,address)` param `collector`
    *Reference: Missing zero-address validation*

> Planned fix: add `require(collector != address(0), "collector zero")` in both constructor and `setTax`. Re-run Slither after the patch to confirm.

## üß≠ Repro Steps

```bash
# 1) Tests + gas table
forge test --gas-report -vv | tee reports/gas-day2.txt

# 2) Coverage
forge coverage | tee reports/coverage-day2.txt

# 3) Slither (filters third-party, build artifacts, and _wip)
slither . --config-file slither.config.json | tee reports/slither-day2.txt
# or:
# slither . --filter-paths "lib|out|_wip" --exclude solc-version,naming-convention,pragma | tee reports/slither-day2.txt
```

## üóìÔ∏è What‚Äôs Next (Day 3)

1. Prepare `.env`: `PRIVATE_KEY`, `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`, `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`
2. Deploy & verify Factory:
   `forge script script/DeployFactory.s.sol --rpc-url ... --broadcast --verify`
3. Mint a token via `cast send createToken(...)` and `forge verify-contract` for that token
4. Produce `docs/day3.md` and `reports/deploy-day3.txt` with addresses and verification links
